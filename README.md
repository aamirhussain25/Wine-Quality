# Wine-Quality
The project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using machine learning algorithms. This can help in quality control and optimizing the production process.

# Introduction
Wine quality is an important factor for both producers and consumers. This project leverages data science and machine learning to predict wine quality based on physicochemical tests. The dataset used contains various chemical properties of wine along with quality ratings.

# Data

The dataset used in this project is the [Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) ,It includes data for both red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The data includes the following features:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

The data files included in this project are:

- winequality-red.csv: Data for red wine variants.
- winequality-white.csv: Data for white wine variants.
- winequality.names: Description of the dataset features.

# Quality Distribution
The histograms show the distribution of quality ratings for both red and white wines.
